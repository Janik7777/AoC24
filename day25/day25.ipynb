    "When you get there, you are surprised to discover that the door to his office is locked! You can hear someone inside, but knocking yields no response. The locks on this floor are all fancy, expensive, virtual versions of five-pin tumbler locks, so you contact North Pole security to see if they can help open the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, they've lost track of which locks are installed and which keys go with them, so the best they can do is send over schematics of every lock and every key for the floor you're on (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The schematics are in a cryptic file format, but they do contain manufacturer information, so you look up their support number.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"The virtual system is complicated, but part of it really is a crude simulation of a five-pin tumbler lock, mostly for marketing reasons. If you look at the schematics, you can figure out whether a key could possibly fit in a lock.\"\n",
